# Installation

Install the latest version of `meeg_tools` from PyPI into a virtual environment:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Since the `meeg_tools` project is under development, I would recommend installing it from
source in editable mode with `pip`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/weiglszonja/meeg-tools.git
$ cd meeg-tools
$ pip install -e .
```

# Usage

Launch the preprocessing notebook with and follow the instructions described
within the notebook.  
For more reference, visit the project [documentation](https://github.com/weiglszonja/meeg-tools).

```bash
$ jupyter notebook preprocessing_notebook.ipynb
```
